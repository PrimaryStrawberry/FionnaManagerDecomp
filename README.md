# Fionna Manager Decompilation
This is a github repo for this games full decomp. I found this game on reddit [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/ExpansionHentai/comments/phf8d9/f_someone_made_a_free_little_growth_game/)(NSFW warning) , **I did not make this.**  all credit goes to [@bulumblebee](https://twitter.com/bulumblebee) on Twitter/X. 
### Notes
This requires [Godot version 3.3](https://godotengine.org/download/archive/3.4-stable/) (I used specifically 3.3.4)
## Changes

 - Added Buttons to instantly set maximum stats.
 - a node change for the buttons
 - added an android sdk thingy, idk
 - Fixed bug with reset button (now it resets bust correctly)
 
 ## How I did this
 I found a tool called [gdsdecomp.](https://github.com/bruvzg/gdsdecomp) 
 It decompiles unencrypted Godot games.
after decompiling I just kinda booted it up and tested it out.

if you do not want your games decompiled, read the [godot docs here](https://docs.godotengine.org/en/stable/contributing/development/compiling/compiling_with_script_encryption_key.html)
